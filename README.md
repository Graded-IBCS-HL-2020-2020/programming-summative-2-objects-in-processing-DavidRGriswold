# Second Programming Summative - IB Computer Science I, 2020

This summative comes in 2 parts. You will ONLY be editing code inside the `src` folder, but will need to edit all four files to get the program fully functioning!

## Part 1 - Programming

Your PRIMARY goal is to get the program running. This is necessary for a **Proficient**. I have marked all the things you need to do with comments marked `SUMMATIVE REQUIRED`.

I recommend that you START by getting the ***balls*** all working. Edit `Ball.java` and `Sketch.java` as appropriate to get four bouncing balls. Once you have successfully done that, you can move on to `Bubble.java` and then `Snowflake.java`.

If you would like to earn an **Accomplished** or **Exemplary** on the programming side of this project, you will need to go beyond the requirements. I have marked several possible extensions in the code with the phrase `SUMMATIVE OPTIONAL` but you do not need to restrict yourself to those. You can extend this project however you would like! You also do not need to do ALL of the optional suggestions to earn an accomplished or exemplary - do as much as is reasonable for you!

## Part 2 - Documenting

Create UML class diagrams for all three the support classes, and a flowchart that shows the basic program flow of `Sketch.java`.

You can do these by hand (be neat!) or using an online tool - draw.io and lucidchart are both nice
online offerings.

For a **Proficient** all of the documentation must be included, correct, and clear. 

You cannot earn an **Accomplished** or **Exemplary** on the documentation half of this project (and do not need to).
